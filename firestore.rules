/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a public, open collaboration model centered around "Sessions".
 * Once a session is created, all data within it is publicly accessible and modifiable by anyone.
 * This ensures that anyone with a link can immediately collaborate without authentication.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized hierarchically under the `/sessions/{sessionId}` collection. Each
 * session document acts as the root for its own data tree, containing subcollections for `listings`, which in
 * turn contain `comments` and `votes`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Fully Public Access: All data within a session is public. Anyone can read, write, update, and delete
 *   listings, comments, and votes. This is intentional to facilitate frictionless collaboration.
 * - Session Creation: Only authenticated users can create new sessions to prevent anonymous abuse of
 *   resource creation. The creator is automatically set as the owner.
 * - Session Management: Only the original owner of a session can delete it or manage its top-level details,
 *   providing a safeguard against malicious deletion of an entire session by a public user.
